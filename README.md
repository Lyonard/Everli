# Hello, recruiter!

I'm **Roberto Tucci** and here's my submission for the technical assessment you've provided.
Please note that Python is not a language I use everyday but nonetheless I wanted to try solving it in that language.

# Solutions

Each task solution can be found in the folder named _taskN_, with N being the task number specified in the instructions.

## My notes
### Task 1
I didn't get if you wanted the I/O being a decimal number or a binary number. 

I've implemented a decimal version that converts the number into a binary string, reverses it and converts it back into decimal.

If that's not what you want, I hope we will be able to talk about an alternative solution in a call :) 

### Task 3
Please be merciful, Python is not (yet) my language :) 
Also, I didn't get if you wanted me to implement the haversine function, so I took the easiest approach and asked Google :)
